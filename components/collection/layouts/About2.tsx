            This web application is designed for students of Jigjiga University
            who have lost or have expired ID or mail cards. Through this
            platform, students can easily apply for replacement cards online
            without visiting the administration in person.
        
            Once an application is submitted, students receive real-time updates
            on the status of their request. Applications are reviewed by the
            Student Dean's office, which may approve or reject the request based
            on the provided details.
    
         
            If approved, students will receive a secure approval code via
            notification, which they must present at the Deanâ€™s Office to
            collect their new ID or mail card. In case of rejection, a reason
            will be provided for transparency and guidance.
